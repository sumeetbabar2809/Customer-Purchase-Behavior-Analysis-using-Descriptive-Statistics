# Probability and Statistics Project

Welcome to the Probability and Statistics project! 📊🔍 This project allows you to apply concepts from probability theory and statistics to analyze a real-world dataset. You'll gain practical experience in data analysis, exploring customer information and purchasing behavior to optimize marketing strategies and increase offer acceptance rates. 🚀

## Dataset Description

The dataset was gathered during last year's campaign and includes the following variables:

- **Response:** 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise
- **ID:** Unique ID of each customer
- **Year_Birth:** Age of the customer
- **Complain:** 1 if the customer complained in the last 2 years
- **Dt_Customer:** Date of customer's enrollment with the company
- **Education:** Customer's level of education
- **Marital:** Customer's marital status
- **Kidhome:** Number of small children in customer's household
- **Teenhome:** Number of teenagers in customer's household
- **Income:** Customer's yearly household income
- **MntFishProducts:** Amount spent on fish products in the last 2 years
- **MntMeatProducts:** Amount spent on meat products in the last 2 years
- **MntFruits:** Amount spent on fruit products in the last 2 years
- **MntSweetProducts:** Amount spent on sweet products in the last 2 years
- **MntWines:** Amount spent on wine products in the last 2 years
- **MntGoldProds:** Amount spent on gold products in the last 2 years
- **NumDealsPurchases:** Number of purchases made with discount
- **NumCatalogPurchases:** Number of purchases made using catalog
- **NumStorePurchases:** Number of purchases made directly in stores
- **NumWebPurchases:** Number of purchases made through the company's website
- **NumWebVisitsMonth:** Number of visits to company's website in the last month
- **Recency:** Number of days since the last purchase

## Tasks and Deliverables

### Task 1 - Basic CleanUp
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, data types, etc.).

### Task 2 - Descriptive Statistics 📊
- Calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation) for key variables.
- Identify and handle outliers if necessary.

### Task 3 - Probability Distributions 🎲
- Identify variables suitable for specific probability distributions (e.g., Binomial, Normal).
- Calculate probabilities and expected values based on these distributions.

### Task 4 - Insights and Customer Segmentation 📈
- Explore relationships between customer characteristics and spending habits.
- Segment customers based on behaviors and characteristics.

### Task 5 - Conclusion and Recommendations
- Create visualizations to present your findings effectively.
- Provide actionable recommendations for the company based on your analysis.
